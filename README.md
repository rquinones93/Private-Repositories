# 2D Games made in Java
## Tank Wars
A two player, birds-eye view game in which the players battle it out in tanks. The game is displayed in a single JFrame, using a split screen with the current view around each player, as well as a minimap. The purpose of this game was to introduce game design principles, the Singleton and MVC control patterns, as well as reinforce object oriented design principles.

## Lazarus
A single player platformer, where the player stacks boxes that fall from the sky in order to make their way to the end of the level. Was created after Tank Wars, in order to re-implement classes that were already written.
